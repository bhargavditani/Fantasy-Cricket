# Fantasy-Cricket
Final Project Internshala. It is an online game where you create a virtual team of real cricket players and score points depending on how your chosen players perform in real life matches. To win a tournament, you must try and get the maximum points and the No. 1 rank amongst other participants.

## Getting Started
In order to use this project, you'll need to install the required python packages: ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

Once you're done with requirements, run the "main.py" script.

Now you are all set up!
